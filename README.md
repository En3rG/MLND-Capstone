# Machine Learning Nanodegree - Capstone
### Portfolio Optimizer

This project generates hundreds of models to determine which one will have optimal performance with stocks provided.

### Requirements

This project requires Python 3.X and the following libraries installed.  During development I was using Python 3.5.3.
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Tensorflow
- Keras

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a <a href="http://ipython.org/notebook.html">Jupyter Notebook</a> 

You can install the requirements using the command below:

'''python
pip install -r requirements.txt
'''

### Run

Download or clone the repository.  In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory and run the following command:

'''python
jupyter notebook portfolio_optimizer.ipynb
'''

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and notebook file in your browser.
